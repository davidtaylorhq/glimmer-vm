The `@glimmer/vm-constants` package provides the values of primitive constants (strings and numbers).

Its contents are usually inlined into other packages. Since the values are primitives, there is no concern about duplication.

If you need these values at runtime, it is perfectly fine to import this package into your application (or another package) as a regular dependency.
